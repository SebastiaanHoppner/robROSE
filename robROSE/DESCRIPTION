Description: A robust approach for dealing with imbalanced data. The robROSE method is a robust version of ROSE (Menardi and Torelli, 2014) which uses the Minimum Covariance Determinant (MCD) estimator (Rousseeuw and Van Driessen, 1999) to cope simultaneously with the problem of imbalanced data and the presence of outliers in the minority class.
